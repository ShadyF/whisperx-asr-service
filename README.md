## What This Does

- Transcribes audio files using OpenAI Whisper models
- Identifies speakers ("Who spoke when") using Pyannote.audio
- Returns word-level timestamps
- Supports 90+ languages
- Outputs JSON, SRT, VTT, TSV formats
- Runs on your own GPU hardware via Docker

## Limitations

- **Not production-grade**: Basic error handling, no authentication
- **GPU required**: Needs an NVIDIA GPU; ~5GB VRAM covers the large models
- **File size limits**: Large audio files (>1GB) can cause out-of-memory errors
- **VRAM usage**: Memory consumption increases with file size and diarization
- **Alpha software**: Expect bugs and breaking changes

## How It Works

```
Audio --> Whisper (transcription) --> Wav2Vec2 (alignment) --> Pyannote (speaker ID) --> Output
```

The service supports two serving modes:

- **Simple mode** (default): Single-process uvicorn with an async GPU queue. Requests are serialized through a semaphore so only one pipeline runs on the GPU at a time. Good for single-GPU, low-traffic, or development use.
- **Ray Serve mode**: Runs on Ray Serve with cross-request batching (`@serve.batch`). Scales from 1 GPU to multi-GPU. Two pipeline strategies are available:
  - **Replicate** (default): Each GPU runs the complete pipeline (Whisper + Align + Diarize). 4 GPUs = 4 independent pipeline replicas, no cross-GPU data transfer.
  - **Split**: Each stage runs as a separate deployment with fractional GPU allocation. Useful when you want independent scaling per stage.

## Prerequisites

### Hardware Requirements

GPU memory requirements vary by model size:

| Whisper Model | VRAM Required (with diarization) | Suitable GPUs |
|---------------|----------------------------------|---------------|
| tiny, base | ~1GB | Any CUDA GPU with 2GB+ |
| small | ~1.5GB | GTX 1660, RTX 2060, or better |
| medium, distil-large-v3.5, large-v3-turbo | ~3GB | RTX 2070, RTX 3060, or better |
| large-v2, large-v3 | ~5GB | RTX 3060 8GB, RTX 2080, **RTX 3090**, or better |

*Note: Measured on an RTX 3090 (float16, batch 16) running transcription +
alignment + pyannote community-1 diarization. Leave headroom above these
figures for concurrent requests and larger batches.*

**Minimum Configuration (small/medium models):**
- GPU: NVIDIA GPU with 6GB VRAM (e.g. RTX 2060) or better
- CPU: 8+ cores
- RAM: 16GB
- Storage: 50GB SSD

**Recommended (large-v3 with diarization):**
- GPU: NVIDIA RTX 3090 (24GB VRAM) or RTX 4090
- CPU: 12+ cores
- RAM: 32GB
- Storage: 100GB SSD

### Software Requirements

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose**
- **NVIDIA Docker Runtime** (for GPU support)
- **Hugging Face Account** (for speaker diarization models)

## Image Variants

Three prebuilt Docker images are published per release. They differ in the
PyTorch wheel and platform they ship; the application code is identical.

| Tag | PyTorch | CUDA wheels | Platform | Supported GPUs |
|-----|---------|-------------|----------|----------------|
| `:latest`, `:X.Y.Z` | 2.7.1 | cu126 | amd64 | Pascal (10xx) through Hopper. Compatible with the broadest GPU range. |
| `:blackwell`, `:X.Y.Z-blackwell` | 2.8.0 | cu128 | amd64 | Blackwell (RTX 50xx). Drops Pascal/Maxwell support per the PyTorch 2.8 cuDNN/CUDA 12.8 build. |
| `:spark`, `:X.Y.Z-spark` | 2.12.0 | cu130 | arm64 | NVIDIA DGX Spark (GB10, sm_121). CTranslate2 compiled from source. |

If you have an RTX 50xx, use the `-blackwell` tag. On a DGX Spark, use the
`-spark` tag. Everyone else: use `:latest`.

**Tested hardware disclaimer.** I develop and test on RTX 3090 (Ampere)
hardware only. The default `:latest` images are validated end to end on that
hardware before release. The `-blackwell` and `-spark` variants are built
from the same source in CI but I cannot run them; they rely on community
validation. The Spark recipe was contributed and hardware-tested by the
community (PR #23). Please report regressions on these variants in the
issues.

To build a custom variant locally, override the build args:

```bash
docker build \
  --build-arg TORCH_VERSION=2.7.1 \
  --build-arg TORCH_INDEX_URL=https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126 \
  -t whisperx-asr-service:custom .
```

## Quick Start (Prebuilt Image)

Get up and running in 3 steps using the prebuilt Docker image:

### 1. Get Hugging Face Token and Model Access

Speaker diarization requires a Hugging Face token and model access:

**a) Create Hugging Face Account:**
- Visit: [https://huggingface.co/join](https://huggingface.co/join) and sign up

**b) Accept Model User Agreements (ALL REQUIRED):**

You need to accept agreements for all three models:
1. [pyannote/speaker-diarization-community-1](https://huggingface.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-community-1) - Click "Agree and access repository"
2. [pyannote/segmentation-3.0](https://huggingface.co/pyannote/segmentation-3.0) - Click "Agree and access repository"
3. [pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1](https://huggingface.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1) - Click "Agree and access repository"

**c) Generate Access Token:**
- Visit: [https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
- Click "New token", name it (e.g., "whisperx-diarization")
- Select "Read" permission and generate
- Copy the token (starts with `hf_...`)

⚠️ **Important:** Without accepting all model agreements, you'll get "403 Access Denied" errors.

### 2. Create Configuration File

Create a `.env` file with your Hugging Face token:

```bash
# Create .env file
cat > .env << 'EOF'
HF_TOKEN=hf_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
DEVICE=cuda
COMPUTE_TYPE=float16
BATCH_SIZE=16
PRELOAD_MODEL=large-v3
MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB=1000
# Serve mode: simple (default) or ray (Ray Serve with batching)
SERVE_MODE=simple
EOF
```

Replace `hf_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` with your actual token.

### 3. Run with Docker Compose (Recommended)

Download the docker-compose.yml file and start the service:

```bash
# Download docker-compose.yml
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/murtaza-nasir/whisperx-asr-service/main/docker-compose.yml

# RTX 50xx (Blackwell) only: switch to the blackwell image
# sed -i 's|whisperx-asr-service:latest|whisperx-asr-service:blackwell|' docker-compose.yml

# Start the service (pulls prebuilt image automatically)
docker compose up -d

# Check logs
docker compose logs -f
```

The bundled `docker-compose.yml` uses `:latest` (PyTorch 2.7.1 / cu126),
which works on every NVIDIA card from Pascal through Hopper. RTX 50xx
users should swap to `:blackwell` (PyTorch 2.8.0 / cu128). See
[Image Variants](#image-variants) for the full matrix.

**Or run with Docker command:**

```bash
# Pick the right tag for your GPU:
IMAGE=ghcr.io/shadyf/whisperx-asr-service:latest      # 10xx-40xx, A/H-series
# IMAGE=ghcr.io/shadyf/whisperx-asr-service:blackwell # RTX 50xx only

docker run -d \
  --name whisperx-asr-api \
  --gpus all \
  -p 9000:9000 \
  -e DEVICE=cuda \
  -e COMPUTE_TYPE=float16 \
  -e BATCH_SIZE=16 \
  -e HF_TOKEN=hf_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx \
  -e PRELOAD_MODEL=large-v3 \
  -v whisperx-cache:/.cache \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  "$IMAGE"
```

The service will be available at `http://localhost:9000`

### 4. Test the Service

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:9000/health

# Test transcription
curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/asr \
  -F "audio_file=@your_audio.mp3" \
  -F "language=en"
```

---

## Build from Source (Advanced)

For development or if you want to build from source:

### 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/murtaza-nasir/whisperx-asr-service.git
cd whisperx-asr-service
```

### 2. Set Up Environment

```bash
# Copy example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env and add your Hugging Face token
nano .env
```

### 3. Build and Run

**Using docker-compose.dev.yml (with live code mounting):**

```bash
# Build and start
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --build

# Check logs
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs -f
```

**Or build manually:**

```bash
# Build image
docker build -t whisperx-asr-service .

# Run container
docker run -d \
  --name whisperx-asr-api \
  --gpus all \
  -p 9000:9000 \
  --env-file .env \
  -v whisperx-cache:/.cache \
  whisperx-asr-service
```

**Note:** The `docker-compose.dev.yml` file mounts `./app` directory for live code changes without rebuilding.

### Advanced Speaker Diarization Features

#### Native Faster-Whisper Decode Per VAD Chunk

`WHISPER_DECODE_MODE` is a process-wide startup setting. The default,
`batched`, preserves the existing WhisperX batched transcription path. Set
`WHISPER_DECODE_MODE=native` to retain the existing Pyannote ASR VAD and decode
each merged VAD chunk serially through the already-loaded faster-whisper model;
it does not load a second Whisper model. `BATCH_SIZE` is ignored only in native
mode. Alignment remains configurable with `ALIGN_DEVICE` (for example `cpu`),
and speaker diarization behavior is unchanged.

Native mode uses conservative faster-whisper decoder rejection thresholds and
fallback temperatures to reduce repetition on difficult chunks. It is an
experiment: start with the existing VAD configuration
`VAD_CHUNK_SIZE=20`, `VAD_ONSET=.500`, and `VAD_OFFSET=.363` rather than
changing those thresholds at the same time. Because decoding is serial, use
`GPU_CONCURRENCY=1`; on constrained cards such as a GTX 1660, `ALIGN_DEVICE=cpu`
also leaves more GPU memory for decoding.

```yaml
WHISPER_DECODE_MODE: native
VAD_CHUNK_SIZE: "20"
VAD_ONSET: "0.500"
VAD_OFFSET: "0.363"
GPU_CONCURRENCY: "1"
ALIGN_DEVICE: cpu
```

#### ASR VAD and Speaker Diarization Are Separate

`VAD_CHUNK_SIZE`, `VAD_ONSET`, and `VAD_OFFSET` configure speech-activity
detection used while WhisperX constructs transcription segments. They are
process-wide settings, read when the service starts and applied when each
cached Whisper model is created; requests cannot override them. The initial
Compose values are `20`, `.500`, and `.363` respectively (the application
defaults are `30`, `.500`, and `.363` when these variables are absent).

Smaller chunks may reduce decoder repetition but lose some context and add
processing overhead. Increasing `VAD_OFFSET` can end speech regions sooner,
but may clip quiet final words. Higher onset thresholds reject more noise but
can miss quiet speech. `VAD_CHUNK_SIZE`
must be an integer from 5 through 60, and thresholds must satisfy
`0 <= VAD_OFFSET <= VAD_ONSET <= 1`; invalid values prevent startup.

These controls do **not** tune speaker labels or turn assignment. Those are
handled by Pyannote diarization. In particular, `DIARIZE_PARAM_OVERRIDES`
only deep-merges Pyannote parameters and is isolated from ASR VAD.

#### Exact Speaker Count

When you know the exact number of speakers, use `num_speakers` for more accurate diarization:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/asr \
  -F "audio_file=@interview.mp3" \
  -F "num_speakers=2" \
  -F "diarize=true"
```

This overrides `min_speakers` and `max_speakers` and typically provides better accuracy than range-based detection.

#### Exclusive Speaker Diarization

This service automatically uses **exclusive speaker diarization** when available from the pyannote community-1 model. This feature simplifies reconciliation between fine-grained speaker diarization timestamps and transcription timestamps, making it ideal for applications like [Speakr](https://github.com/murtaza-nasir/speakr) where you need to align transcripts with speaker segments.

**Benefits:**
- More accurate timestamp alignment between speakers and words
- Better handling of speaker transitions
- Simplified post-processing for multi-speaker transcripts

#### Tuning Diarization Hyperparameters

When speakers are merged into a single label, or short back-and-forth turns are missed, the pyannote community-1 pipeline can be tuned through environment variables. These are unset by default, so the service runs with the model's published defaults unless you opt in. The pipeline's full default parameter schema is logged at startup; for community-1 it is `{'segmentation': {'min_duration_off': 0.0}, 'clustering': {'threshold': 0.6, 'Fa': 0.07, 'Fb': 0.8}}`.

| Variable | Effect | Typical values |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| `DIARIZE_CLUSTERING_THRESHOLD` | The main lever for merged speakers. Lower it to split similar or merged voices more aggressively; raise it for fewer speakers. | `0.4`-`0.8` (default `0.6`; lower = more speakers) |
| `DIARIZE_MIN_DURATION_OFF` | Non-speech gaps shorter than this (seconds) are filled, merging the turns on either side. Raise it to suppress over-segmentation. It does not recover rapid turns, since the default is already `0.0`. | `0.0`-`0.5` (default `0.0`) |
| `DIARIZE_PARAM_OVERRIDES` | Escape hatch: a JSON object deep-merged into the pipeline's instantiated parameters, for any key the variables above do not cover (for example `clustering.Fa`, `clustering.Fb`). | `{"clustering": {"Fb": 1.0}}` |
| `DIARIZE_FILL_NEAREST` | Assign the nearest speaker to words/segments that fall outside every diarization turn, instead of leaving them untagged. Fixes "orphan" segments such as a closing line with no speaker label. | `false` (default), `true` |

```bash
# Split merged speakers (the most common fix); tag any orphan segments
DIARIZE_CLUSTERING_THRESHOLD=0.5
DIARIZE_FILL_NEAREST=true
```

These are global settings applied when the pipeline loads. Invalid or unrecognised keys are logged and ignored rather than failing diarization, so the pipeline always falls back to defaults if an override cannot be applied. To find the best value for your audio without restarting the service, use the sweep script described below.

#### Sweeping Parameters on Your Own Audio

`tests/diarize_sweep.py` runs diarization on one file across several settings and reports, per config, the number of speakers, turns, and a turn timeline, so you can see which value recovers your missing turns. It isolates the diarizer (no transcription), so it is fast. Run it as a one-off container so it does not disturb a running service:

```bash
docker run --rm --gpus '"device=0"' \
  -v whisperx-cache:/.cache \
  -v "$PWD/tests:/work/tests:ro" -v "$PWD/testfiles:/work/testfiles:ro" \
  -e HF_TOKEN="$HF_TOKEN" -e HF_HOME=/.cache -e DEVICE=cuda \
  ghcr.io/shadyf/whisperx-asr-service:latest \
  python3 /work/tests/diarize_sweep.py /work/testfiles/your_audio.mp3 --min-speakers 2
```

Pass `--grid "none:none,0.5:0.0,0.45:0.0"` for a custom set of `threshold:min_duration_off` pairs, and `--num-speakers` / `--min-speakers` / `--max-speakers` when the count is known.

For audio that mixes languages within a single file (for example English and Mandarin in one meeting), also consider passing an explicit `language` per request: WhisperX loads one alignment model for the detected language, and poor word-level timestamps from a mismatched alignment model are a common cause of merged or missing speaker turns. Diarization quality is also inherently limited when voices are very similar (for example synthetic or dubbed dialogue).

### Custom Vocabulary (Hotwords)

Whisper often misspells brand names, acronyms, and domain-specific terms. You can improve accuracy using `hotwords` and `initial_prompt`:

- `hotwords` biases the model's beam search to favor specific words during decoding
- `initial_prompt` provides a sentence of context that primes the model to expect certain spellings

**Example:** transcribing audio that says *"We deployed Speakr on a Kubernetes cluster using CTranslate2 for inference. PyAnnote handles the diarization."*

```bash
# Baseline (no hints)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:9000/asr?language=en" \
  -F "audio_file=@meeting.mp3"
# Result: "We deployed Speaker...using ctranslate2...PnNote handles the diarization."

# With hotwords
curl -X POST "http://localhost:9000/asr?language=en&hotwords=Speakr,CTranslate2,PyAnnote" \
  -F "audio_file=@meeting.mp3"
# Result: "We deployed Speaker...using CTranslate2...PyAnnote handles the diarization."

# With hotwords + initial_prompt (best results)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:9000/asr?language=en&hotwords=Speakr,CTranslate2,PyAnnote&initial_prompt=Speakr is a transcription app." \
  -F "audio_file=@meeting.mp3"
# Result: "We deployed Speakr...using CTranslate2...PyAnnote handles the diarization."
```

| Word | No hints | Hotwords | Hotwords + initial_prompt |
|---|---|---|---|
| CTranslate2 | ctranslate2 | CTranslate2 | CTranslate2 |
| PyAnnote | PnNote | PyAnnote | PyAnnote |
| Speakr | Speaker | Speaker | Speakr |

`hotwords` alone fixes most spelling issues. Words that sound identical to common English words (like "Speakr" vs "Speaker") may need `initial_prompt` as well to provide enough context for the model to override its default.

The OpenAI-compatible endpoints (`/v1/audio/transcriptions`) also support a `hotwords` form field. If only `prompt` is provided, it is used as hotwords.

A test script is included to verify hotwords with your own audio:

```bash
./tests/test_hotwords.sh testfiles/your_audio.flac

# Custom hotwords
HOTWORDS="MyBrand,TechTerm" INITIAL_PROMPT="MyBrand is a product." \
  ./tests/test_hotwords.sh testfiles/your_audio.flac
```

## Integration with Speakr

To use this service with [Speakr](https://github.com/murtaza-nasir/speakr) instead of the default ASR endpoint:

### If Running on the Same Machine

Update Speakr's `.env` file:

```bash
# Enable ASR endpoint
USE_ASR_ENDPOINT=true

# Point to WhisperX service
ASR_BASE_URL=http://whisperx-asr-api:9000
```

If Speakr and WhisperX are in the same Docker Compose stack, use the container name. Otherwise, use `http://localhost:9000`.

### If Running on a Different GPU Machine

1. **On GPU Machine:** Deploy this service

```bash
# Make service accessible from network
# Edit docker compose.yml ports:
ports:
  - "0.0.0.0:9000:9000"  # Expose to network
```

2. **On Speakr Machine:** Update configuration

```bash
# In Speakr's .env file
USE_ASR_ENDPOINT=true
ASR_BASE_URL=http://<GPU_MACHINE_IP>:9000
```

**Note:** Replace `<GPU_MACHINE_IP>` with your GPU server's IP address. Use firewall rules to restrict access to trusted machines only.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Edit `.env` to customize:

```bash
# GPU or CPU processing
DEVICE=cuda              # cuda for GPU, cpu for CPU-only

# Computation precision
COMPUTE_TYPE=float16     # float16 (GPU), float32 (CPU), int8 (faster, lower quality)

# Alignment stage device (defaults to DEVICE). cpu keeps the Wav2Vec2
# alignment model off the GPU to reduce VRAM on small cards, at the cost
# of slower word timestamps.
# ALIGN_DEVICE=cpu

# Batch size (higher = faster but more memory). Default is device-aware:
# 16 on cuda, 2 on cpu. Long audio on CPU benefits from BATCH_SIZE=1.
BATCH_SIZE=16           # 16 for 8GB VRAM, 32+ for high-end GPUs, 1-2 on CPU

# Process-wide decoder mode. batched is the compatible default. native reuses
# the cached faster-whisper model and existing Pyannote VAD, then decodes VAD
# chunks serially. BATCH_SIZE is ignored only by native mode.
WHISPER_DECODE_MODE=batched

# Hugging Face token for diarization
HF_TOKEN=hf_xxx...

# Model preloading (optional, reduces first-request latency)
PRELOAD_MODEL=large-v3   # Leave empty to disable, or set to: tiny, base, small, medium, large-v2, large-v3

# Maximum file size in MB (prevents out-of-memory errors)
MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB=1000    # Default 1GB, adjust lower for GPUs with <16GB VRAM

# Idle model eviction (default disabled). When > 0, Whisper models that have
# not served a request in this many seconds are unloaded from memory by a
# background sweep. The next request that needs the model will reload it.
MODEL_KEEP_ALIVE_SECONDS=0          # 0 disables eviction; e.g. 3600 = 1 hour
MODEL_EVICTION_INTERVAL_SECONDS=60  # Sweep frequency (floor of 30 seconds)

# ASR speech-activity detection. These settings are read at process startup
# and passed when each cached Whisper model is built; they are not per-request
# controls and do not affect Pyannote speaker diarization.
# Smaller chunks add overhead but can follow boundaries more closely. Higher
# thresholds reject more noise but can miss quiet speech. Values must satisfy
# 5 <= VAD_CHUNK_SIZE <= 60 and 0 <= VAD_OFFSET <= VAD_ONSET <= 1.
VAD_CHUNK_SIZE=20
VAD_ONSET=.500
VAD_OFFSET=.363

# Diarization hyperparameter tuning (optional, unset = model defaults).
# See "Tuning Diarization Hyperparameters" above for details.
# DIARIZE_CLUSTERING_THRESHOLD=0.5   # default 0.6; lower = split merged voices
# DIARIZE_MIN_DURATION_OFF=0.2       # default 0.0; raise = reduce over-segmentation
# DIARIZE_PARAM_OVERRIDES={"clustering": {"Fb": 1.0}}  # JSON escape hatch (Fa/Fb)
# DIARIZE_FILL_NEAREST=false         # true = tag orphan segments with nearest speaker
# DIARIZE_PARAM_OVERRIDES changes only Pyannote diarization parameters. It
# does not affect the separate ASR VAD settings above.

# Rebuild segments at speaker-change boundaries after diarization, so rapid
# turns are not merged into one speaker's segment. Always on for the qwen3
# backend; opt-in here for the whisper backend (changes segment shape
# compared to previous releases).
# RESEGMENT_BY_SPEAKER=true

# Experimental Qwen3-ASR backend (see "Qwen3-ASR Backend" below).
# ASR_BACKEND=qwen3
# QWEN3_ASR_MODEL=Qwen/Qwen3-ASR-1.7B-hf
# QWEN3_ALIGNER_MODEL=Qwen/Qwen3-ForcedAligner-0.6B-hf
# QWEN3_CHUNK_SECONDS=90
# QWEN3_DEFAULT_CONTEXT=            # standing vocabulary/context biasing text
```

### Serve Mode

Controlled by the `SERVE_MODE` environment variable in your `.env` file.

#### Simple Mode (default)

```bash
SERVE_MODE=simple
```

Runs uvicorn directly. Requests are serialized through an async GPU semaphore so the event loop stays responsive while GPU work runs in a thread pool. This is backward-compatible with previous versions.

You can tune `GPU_CONCURRENCY=1` (default) to control how many pipeline runs execute concurrently. Leave at 1 for single-GPU setups.

#### Ray Serve Mode

```bash
SERVE_MODE=ray
```

Runs on Ray Serve with cross-request batching (`@serve.batch`). Two pipeline strategies are available, controlled by `PIPELINE_STRATEGY`:

##### Replicate Strategy (default, recommended)

```bash
PIPELINE_STRATEGY=replicate
NUM_GPU_REPLICAS=4       # one full pipeline per GPU
```

Each GPU runs the complete 3-stage pipeline. Ray Serve routes incoming requests across replicas.

```
                    +-- GPU 0: [Whisper + Align + Diarize] --+
HTTP --> Proxy -->  +-- GPU 1: [Whisper + Align + Diarize] --+--> Response
                    +-- GPU 2: [Whisper + Align + Diarize] --+
                    +-- GPU 3: [Whisper + Align + Diarize] --+
```

##### Split Strategy

```bash
PIPELINE_STRATEGY=split
```

Each pipeline stage runs as a separate deployment with fractional GPU allocation and cross-request batching (`@serve.batch`). Stage-level pipelining means request B can start transcription while request A is still in diarization.

```
HTTP --> Proxy --> ASR Ingress
                       |
              +--------+--------+
              |        |        |
          Whisper   Align    Diarize
         (GPU 0.5) (GPU 0.3) (GPU 0.2)
```

##### Strategy Comparison

Both strategies achieve similar throughput (~6.3-6.5x speedup on 4x RTX 3090 with 8 concurrent workers).

| | Replicate | Split |
|---|-----------|-------|
| **Configuration** | Simple (just set `NUM_GPU_REPLICAS`) | Complex (GPU fractions, per-stage replicas, bin-packing tuning) |
| **Cross-GPU transfer** | None (audio stays on one GPU) | Yes (results move between stages) |
| **Tail latency** | Higher variance | Lower and more consistent |
| **Scaling** | Add a GPU, add a replica | Scale bottleneck stages independently (e.g. more Whisper replicas) |
| **VRAM per GPU** | Must fit all 3 models | Each stage uses a fraction |
| **Best for** | Most setups, multi-GPU throughput | Advanced tuning, heterogeneous stage scaling |

##### Ray Serve Configuration

All optional, shown with defaults:

```bash
# Pipeline strategy: replicate (full pipeline per GPU) or split (stage per GPU)
PIPELINE_STRATEGY=replicate

# Number of pipeline replicas (set to number of GPUs)
NUM_GPU_REPLICAS=1

# Cross-request batch sizes per stage (tune for GPU VRAM)
WHISPER_BATCH_SIZE=4
ALIGN_BATCH_SIZE=8
DIARIZE_BATCH_SIZE=2

# Seconds to wait collecting a batch before processing what's available
BATCH_WAIT_TIMEOUT=0.1

# Split strategy only: fractional GPU allocation per stage
WHISPER_GPU_FRACTION=0.5
ALIGN_GPU_FRACTION=0.3
DIARIZE_GPU_FRACTION=0.2

# Split strategy only: per-stage replica overrides (fall back to NUM_GPU_REPLICAS)
# WHISPER_NUM_REPLICAS=2
# ALIGN_NUM_REPLICAS=1
# DIARIZE_NUM_REPLICAS=1
```

##### Multi-GPU Examples

```bash
# 4 GPUs, full pipeline on each (recommended)
SERVE_MODE=ray
PIPELINE_STRATEGY=replicate
NUM_GPU_REPLICAS=4

# 3 GPUs, one stage per GPU
SERVE_MODE=ray
PIPELINE_STRATEGY=split
WHISPER_GPU_FRACTION=1.0
ALIGN_GPU_FRACTION=1.0
DIARIZE_GPU_FRACTION=1.0

# 4 GPUs, hybrid: 2 Whisper + 1 Align + 1 Diarize
SERVE_MODE=ray
PIPELINE_STRATEGY=split
WHISPER_NUM_REPLICAS=2  WHISPER_GPU_FRACTION=1.0
ALIGN_NUM_REPLICAS=1    ALIGN_GPU_FRACTION=1.0
DIARIZE_NUM_REPLICAS=1  DIARIZE_GPU_FRACTION=1.0
```

When running in Ray mode, the Ray Dashboard is available at `http://localhost:8265` for monitoring deployments, replicas, and request metrics.

##### GPU Pinning

To restrict which GPUs the service uses, create a `docker-compose.dev.local.yml` override (gitignored):

```yaml
services:
  whisperx-asr:
    environment:
      - CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3
      - NUM_GPU_REPLICAS=4
```

Use `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` (not `NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`) since the Docker Compose `deploy` section exposes all GPUs to the container.

Then start with:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml -f docker-compose.dev.local.yml up -d
```

### Model Selection

Available Whisper models (speed vs accuracy tradeoff):

| Model | Parameters | VRAM (loaded) | VRAM (full pipeline*) | Speed | Quality |
|-------|------------|---------------|----------------------|-------|---------|
| `tiny` | 39M | 0.5GB | 1.0GB | Fastest | Lowest |
| `base` | 74M | 0.6GB | 1.1GB | Very Fast | Low |
| `small` | 244M | 0.9GB | 1.5GB | Fast | Medium |
| `medium` | 769M | 2.2GB | 2.8GB | Moderate | Good |
| `distil-large-v3.5` | 756M | 2.2GB | 2.8GB | Fast | Near-best |
| `large-v3-turbo` | 809M | 2.3GB | 2.9GB | Fast | Near-best |
| `large-v2` | 1550M | 3.9GB | 4.6GB | Slow | Excellent |
| `large-v3` | 1550M | 3.9GB | 4.6GB | Slow | Best |

*Measured on an RTX 3090 (float16, `BATCH_SIZE=16`, 12-minute file), running
transcription, alignment, and pyannote diarization. Peak VRAM occurs during
transcription; alignment and diarization add little on top. Actual peaks vary
somewhat with audio content and batch size.

**Recommendation:**
- Use `large-v3` for best quality (fits comfortably in 6GB+ VRAM)
- Use `distil-large-v3.5` or `large-v3-turbo` for near-large quality at
  about half the VRAM and higher speed
- Use `small` or `medium` for tight VRAM budgets (2-3GB)

### Qwen3-ASR Backend (Experimental)

Setting `ASR_BACKEND=qwen3` replaces the transcription and alignment stages
with Qwen3-ASR (`Qwen/Qwen3-ASR-1.7B-hf`) and the Qwen3 forced aligner
(`Qwen/Qwen3-ForcedAligner-0.6B-hf`), loaded through stock transformers.
Diarization is unchanged.

Why use it:

- The forced aligner is a single model covering zh, en, yue, fr, de, it,
  ja, ko, pt, ru, and es. Code-switched audio (for example Chinese and
  English in one recording) is transcribed and word-aligned in one pass,
  which the per-language Wav2Vec2 alignment stage cannot do.
- `hotwords` and `initial_prompt` become free-text context biasing, which
  corrects domain terms more reliably than token-level hotwords.

Why not:

- Roughly 10x slower than faster-whisper (about 12x realtime vs 116x on an
  RTX 3090). The full pipeline uses about 6 GB VRAM with the default 1.7B
  model (vs 4.6 GB for whisper large-v3), or about 3.6 GB with
  `QWEN3_ASR_MODEL=Qwen/Qwen3-ASR-0.6B-hf`.
- The requested Whisper model name is ignored and `task=translate` falls
  back to the whisper backend.
- Audio is processed in 90-second chunks (`QWEN3_CHUNK_SECONDS`); words
  spanning a chunk boundary may be split.

Weights (about 4.6 GB total) download to the cache volume on first use, the
same as every other model. Nothing downloads unless the backend is enabled.

```bash
ASR_BACKEND=qwen3
# Optional overrides (defaults shown):
# QWEN3_ASR_MODEL=Qwen/Qwen3-ASR-1.7B-hf
# QWEN3_ALIGNER_MODEL=Qwen/Qwen3-ForcedAligner-0.6B-hf
# QWEN3_CHUNK_SECONDS=90
# QWEN3_DEFAULT_CONTEXT=          # standing vocabulary/context biasing text
```

**Code-switched audio requires a per-request `language`.** Passing any one
of the mixed languages makes the backend force verbatim transcription (the
other languages are still transcribed in their own script). Without a
language, the model picks the dominant language per chunk and translates
the rest into it; context hints do not prevent this. Speaker segments are
always rebuilt at speaker-change boundaries on this backend (see
`RESEGMENT_BY_SPEAKER` below for the whisper backend).

### External ASR Backend (Experimental)

Setting `ASR_BACKEND=external` outsources only the transcription stage to
an OpenAI-compatible API; alignment, diarization, speaker embeddings, and
voice profiles keep running locally. Be aware that your audio is uploaded
to the configured provider, which is why this is strictly opt-in.

```bash
ASR_BACKEND=external
EXTERNAL_ASR_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
EXTERNAL_ASR_API_KEY=sk-...
EXTERNAL_ASR_MODEL=whisper-1
# EXTERNAL_ASR_MODE=transcriptions   # default; or "chat" for audio-input
                                     # chat models (OpenRouter, vLLM)
```

How word timestamps are produced depends on the provider response.
Providers that return timestamped segments (whisper-1 `verbose_json`,
Groq, self-hosted Whisper servers) feed the existing Wav2Vec2 alignment
stage directly. Text-only providers (gpt-4o-transcribe, Voxtral or other
audio models through OpenRouter's chat API, VibeVoice via vLLM) are
word-timestamped by the Qwen forced aligner instead, which downloads on
first use (~1.2 GB) and adds about 1 GB of VRAM. `task=translate` falls
back to the whisper backend, and the requested Whisper model name is
ignored.

Set `EXTERNAL_ASR_ALIGNER=qwen` to force the Qwen forced aligner even for
timestamped responses; it is language-agnostic across its supported set
and handles code-switched audio, unlike the per-language Wav2Vec2 models.
The reverse is not configurable: Wav2Vec2 requires segment timestamps, so
text-only responses always use the Qwen aligner.

## Running the Service

```bash
# Start in simple mode (default)
docker compose up -d

# Or start in Ray Serve mode
# Set SERVE_MODE=ray in your .env file, then:
docker compose up -d

# View logs
docker compose logs -f
```

**Note:** When using Ray Serve mode, Docker Compose is configured with `shm_size: 8g` for Ray's shared memory object store. The Ray Dashboard is exposed on port 8265.

## Monitoring and Logs

### View Logs

```bash
# Real-time logs
docker compose logs -f

# Last 100 lines
docker compose logs --tail=100

# Specific container logs
docker logs whisperx-asr-api
```

### Health Check

```bash
# Check service health
curl http://localhost:9000/health

# Response:
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "device": "cuda",
  "loaded_models": ["large-v3"],
  "serve_mode": "ray"
}
```

### Prometheus Metrics

`GET /metrics` returns OpenMetrics text format suitable for a Prometheus
scrape config:

```bash
curl http://localhost:9000/metrics
# # HELP whisperx_requests_total Total HTTP requests by endpoint and status
# # TYPE whisperx_requests_total counter
# whisperx_requests_total{endpoint="/asr",status="ok"} 12.0
# whisperx_request_duration_seconds_bucket{endpoint="/asr",le="60.0"} 11.0
# ...
```

| Metric | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| `whisperx_requests_total{endpoint,status}` | Counter | `status` is `ok`, `http_<code>`, or `error` |
| `whisperx_request_duration_seconds{endpoint}` | Histogram | End-to-end handler time |
| `whisperx_active_transcriptions` | Gauge | In-flight `/asr` requests |
| `whisperx_loaded_models` | Gauge | Whisper models currently in cache |
| `whisperx_model_evictions_total{model}` | Counter | Models unloaded by the idle-eviction sweep |
| `whisperx_audio_duration_seconds` | Histogram | Submitted audio duration |
| `whisperx_audio_size_megabytes` | Histogram | Submitted file size |
| `whisperx_vram_allocated_bytes` | Gauge | CUDA `memory_allocated()` (0 on CPU) |
| `whisperx_service_info` | Info | Static labels: version, device, compute_type, serve_mode |

**Ray Serve caveat:** `/metrics` is served by the ingress process. Whisper
models load inside replica processes, so `whisperx_loaded_models`,
`whisperx_vram_allocated_bytes`, and `whisperx_model_evictions_total` will
read 0 (or be missing) in Ray Serve mode. These counters and gauges are
per-process; without `prometheus_client` multi-process mode the ingress'
registry never sees the replica's events. HTTP-level metrics (request
counts, durations, audio sizes) are accurate in both modes because they
are recorded inside the ingress handler. Use the Ray Dashboard at port
8265 for per-replica state, and tail `serve/replica_*` log files for
eviction events. Multi-process metrics support is a planned follow-up.

In simple mode (`SERVE_MODE=simple`) all metrics including the eviction
counter and loaded-model gauge work as expected, since the model cache
and the `/metrics` handler share a process. Each Whisper model load
pre-registers a `whisperx_model_evictions_total{model="<name>"} 0` row
so dashboards can graph the metric from the first load onward, not only
after the first eviction.

The legacy JSON shape (queue/loaded model state) is still available at
`GET /queue-metrics` for callers that depended on it.

### Performance Monitoring

Monitor GPU usage:

```bash
# NVIDIA GPU stats
nvidia-smi -l 1

# Docker container stats
docker stats whisperx-asr-api

# Ray Dashboard (Ray mode only)
# Open http://localhost:8265 in your browser
```

## Offline Use

This service can run completely offline after an initial setup with internet access. This is useful for air-gapped environments or when you want to avoid network latency.

### Initial Setup (requires internet)

1. Start the container with internet access
2. Run at least one transcription request with diarization enabled to cache all models:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/asr \
     -F "audio_file=@test.mp3" \
     -F "diarize=true"
   ```
3. This downloads and caches:
   - Whisper model (e.g., large-v3)
   - Alignment model (wav2vec2)
   - Pyannote speaker diarization models

### Enable Offline Mode

Add `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1` to your `docker-compose.yml` environment section:

```yaml
environment:
  - HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1
  # ... other environment variables
```

**Important:** This must be set directly in `docker-compose.yml`, not in the `.env` file.

Then restart the container:
```bash
docker compose down && docker compose up -d
```

The service will now operate without any network requests to Hugging Face.

### Air-Gapped Transfer (no internet on the target machine)

If the machine that runs the service has no internet at all, populate the cache on an internet-connected machine and move it across as data. Do not rely on `docker commit`: the cache lives in a named Docker volume (`whisperx-cache:/.cache`), and `docker commit` captures only the container filesystem, not volume contents, so a committed-and-exported image arrives with an empty cache and fails to find the models at startup (the Swagger UI will also fail to load).

1. On the online machine, run one transcription with diarization (see above) so every model is cached.
2. Export the cache volume to a tarball:
   ```bash
   docker run --rm -v whisperx-cache:/cache -v "$PWD":/out alpine \
     tar czf /out/whisperx-cache.tgz -C /cache .
   ```
3. Transfer `whisperx-cache.tgz` and the image (`docker save IMAGE | gzip > image.tgz`) to the target machine.
4. On the target machine, load the image, extract the cache, and bind-mount it instead of a named volume:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p /srv/whisperx-cache
   tar xzf whisperx-cache.tgz -C /srv/whisperx-cache
   docker run -d --gpus all -p 9000:9000 \
     -e HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1 \
     -v /srv/whisperx-cache:/.cache \
     ghcr.io/shadyf/whisperx-asr-service:latest
   ```
   On RTX 50xx / Blackwell cards use the `:0.3.2-blackwell` image and keep `COMPUTE_TYPE=float16` (the CTranslate2 INT8 path is not supported on Blackwell).

### What Gets Cached

| Component | Cache Location | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| Whisper models | `/.cache/models--Systran--faster-whisper-*` | Downloaded on first use |
| Alignment model | `/.cache/wav2vec2_*.pth` | Downloaded on first alignment |
| Pyannote models | `/.cache/hub/models--pyannote--*` | Downloaded on first diarization |
| NLTK tokenizers | `/.cache/nltk_data/` | Pre-downloaded in Docker image |

### Troubleshooting Offline Mode

If you see errors like `Failed to resolve 'huggingface.co'`:
1. Ensure you ran a full transcription with diarization while online
2. Verify `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1` is set in `docker-compose.yml` (not `.env`)
3. Check the cache volume contains the models: `docker exec whisperx-asr-api ls -la /.cache/` (faster-whisper models) and `docker exec whisperx-asr-api ls -la /.cache/hub/` (pyannote/HuggingFace models)

## Troubleshooting

### GPU Not Detected

**Symptom:** Service runs on CPU despite having GPU

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify NVIDIA Docker runtime
docker run --rm --gpus all nvidia/cuda:12.1.1-base-ubuntu22.04 nvidia-smi

# If fails, install nvidia-container-toolkit
distribution=$(. /etc/os-release;echo $ID$VERSION_ID)
curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/gpgkey | sudo apt-key add -
curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/$distribution/nvidia-docker.list | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-docker.list
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-container-toolkit
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

### Out of Memory Errors

**Symptom:** `CUDA out of memory` errors or VRAM exhaustion with large files

**Solutions:**
1. **Reduce file size limit** in `.env`: `MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB=500` (default is 1000MB)
2. **Use smaller model**: `small` or `medium` instead of `large-v3`
3. **Reduce batch size** in `.env`: `BATCH_SIZE=8` or `BATCH_SIZE=4`
4. **Use int8 precision**: `COMPUTE_TYPE=int8` (lower quality but less memory)
5. **Split large files**: Process audio in smaller chunks before uploading
6. **Disable diarization**: For very large files, skip speaker diarization

**Note:** The service automatically clears GPU cache between operations to minimize VRAM buildup, but very large files (>500MB) can still cause issues.

### Speaker Diarization Not Working

**Symptom:** No speaker labels in output

**Solutions:**
1. Verify HF_TOKEN is set correctly
2. Accept model user agreements on Hugging Face
3. Check logs for diarization errors: `docker compose logs`
4. Ensure `diarize=true` in request

### Slow Processing

**Symptom:** Transcription takes too long

**Solutions:**
1. Use GPU instead of CPU (`DEVICE=cuda`)
2. Use smaller model for faster processing
3. Increase `BATCH_SIZE` (if you have VRAM)
4. Disable diarization if not needed: `diarize=false`

### PyTorch 2.6 Weights Loading Error

**Symptom:** Error message containing `Weights only load failed` or `GLOBAL omegaconf.listconfig.ListConfig was not an allowed global`

This occurs due to a security change in PyTorch 2.6 where `weights_only=True` became the default for `torch.load()`.

**Solution:**

Add this environment variable to your `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
environment:
  - TORCH_FORCE_NO_WEIGHTS_ONLY_LOAD=true
```

**Important:** Setting this in `.env` file alone may not work - it must be set directly in `docker-compose.yml` under the `environment` section.

See [WhisperX Issue #1304](https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX/issues/1304) for more details.

### API Returns 500 Errors

**Check logs:**
```bash
docker compose logs whisperx-asr
```

Common causes:
- Invalid audio format (use ffmpeg to convert)
- Model not loaded (check VRAM, logs)
- Incorrect parameters (check API docs)

## Supported Audio Formats

The service supports formats that WhisperX can process (via FFmpeg):

- **Audio:** MP3, WAV, M4A, FLAC, AAC, OGG, WMA
- **Video:** MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV, WebM (audio track extracted)
- **Other:** AMR, 3GP, 3GPP

**Note:** Large files (>1GB) may cause out-of-memory errors as files are loaded entirely into memory.

## Security Notes

**This service has NO built-in authentication or security features.**

If exposing to a network:
- Use firewall rules to restrict access
- Consider putting behind a reverse proxy
- Store HF_TOKEN securely (use `.env` file, not hardcoded)

## Maintenance

### Updating WhisperX

If you run the prebuilt image, pull the new tag:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

If you build from source, the default build now installs PyTorch 2.7.1
from the cu126 wheel index (Pascal-Hopper). To target a different combo:

```bash
git pull
docker compose build --no-cache \
  --build-arg TORCH_VERSION=2.8.0 \
  --build-arg TORCH_INDEX_URL=https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
docker compose up -d
```

Build args also work via Compose's `build.args` if you check that into
your overlay file.

### Clearing Cache

```bash
# Remove model cache
docker compose down -v
docker volume rm whisperx-asr-service_whisperx-cache

# Rebuild
docker compose up -d
```

### Backup

Backup the cache volume to preserve downloaded models:

```bash
docker run --rm -v whisperx-asr-service_whisperx-cache:/cache \
  -v $(pwd):/backup ubuntu tar czf /backup/whisperx-cache-backup.tar.gz /cache
```

## Stress Testing

A stress test script is included to measure throughput and latency under concurrent load:

```bash
# Default: 4 concurrent workers, all files in testfiles/
python tests/stress_test.py

# 8 concurrent workers, 3 rounds
python tests/stress_test.py --workers 8 --rounds 3

# Test OpenAI-compat endpoint
python tests/stress_test.py --endpoint openai

# Without diarization
python tests/stress_test.py --no-diarize
```

Place `.mp3` files in the `testfiles/` directory (gitignored). The report shows per-request latency, throughput in requests/minute, and the speedup from concurrent execution. See `tests/README.md` for full details.

## Changelog

### v0.3.2 (2026-05-03)

**Reported issues fixed**

- **Pascal/Blackwell image variants (#15):** `:latest` ships PyTorch 2.7.1 (cu126, supports Pascal through Hopper). New `:blackwell` tag ships PyTorch 2.8.0 (cu128) for RTX 50xx. The `Dockerfile` now exposes `TORCH_VERSION` and `TORCH_INDEX_URL` build args and re-pins torch *after* the WhisperX install so the requested version sticks (the upstream fork was silently upgrading torch to 2.8 and breaking Pascal). CI publishes both variants per release with separate buildx cache scopes; either job can fail independently.
- **Device-aware `BATCH_SIZE` default (#12):** the default is now 16 on cuda and 2 on cpu. The hardcoded 16 was OOM-killing CPU runs (exit 137) on audio longer than ~30 minutes.
- **Idle model eviction (#16):** new `MODEL_KEEP_ALIVE_SECONDS` env var (default 0/disabled) unloads Whisper models that have been idle longer than the configured window. `MODEL_EVICTION_INTERVAL_SECONDS` controls sweep frequency (floor 30s). The next request that needs an evicted model reloads it transparently.
- **Real Prometheus `/metrics` (#13):** `/metrics` now returns OpenMetrics text instead of JSON. New histograms and counters cover request duration, status, audio duration/size, in-flight requests, loaded model count, model evictions, and VRAM. The previous JSON shape is preserved at `/queue-metrics` for callers that depended on it. See [Prometheus Metrics](#prometheus-metrics) for the full table and the Ray Serve caveat.

**Other fixes shipped in v0.3.2**

- `/asr` accepts the OpenAI-style aliases advertised by `/v1/models` (`whisper-1`, `whisper-tiny`, `whisper-large-v3`, ...). Previously these returned a 500 because the raw value was passed straight through to `faster_whisper.WhisperModel`.
- `/v1/models` is sourced from `faster_whisper.available_models()` instead of a hardcoded list, so the advertised set stays in sync with whatever engine version is installed (about 20 canonical names plus the `whisper-1` alias).
- `app.*` log records from Ray Serve replicas now flow into the per-replica log file. Previously `Loading WhisperX model: X`, `Starting transcription...`, etc. were silently dropped because Ray Serve disables propagation on its own logger.
- `whisperx_model_evictions_total{model="<name>"}` is pre-registered with value 0 each time a model loads, so dashboards can graph the metric from the first load onward instead of only after the first eviction. Simple mode only; see the Ray Serve caveat.

**New env vars**

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `MODEL_KEEP_ALIVE_SECONDS` | `0` (disabled) | Idle window after which a Whisper model is unloaded |
| `MODEL_EVICTION_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | `60` (floor 30) | Sweep cadence for the eviction daemon |

**New build args**

| Build arg | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `TORCH_VERSION` | `2.7.1` | PyTorch version to install |
| `TORCH_INDEX_URL` | `https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126` | PyTorch wheel index URL |

**Tests**

`tests/test_v0_3_2.sh` and `tests/test_keep_alive.sh` cover the new endpoints and eviction logic; both verified end-to-end against a Ray Serve container.
